# Project 2: CI/CD

## Your Task

Create a GitHub repository that executes a workflow each time someone commits a change.

This workflow could do one or several of these things:

* test application code
* package / compile application code
* send a message via WhatsApp, Telegram etc
* deploy it to the cloud

The GitHub repository should contain your application code, along with workflows that execute steps to test, package, or deploy it.

### What are we looking to see?

You're free to take this into any direction you would like as long as it fulfills these two things:

* some action is triggered once someone commits a change in the repository
* the GitHub repo link (and README.md file) gives sufficient explanation of what you're trying to achieve, your learning, the steps you take etc.

It's much more important to have a self-explanatory README.md with diagrams, screenshots etc that show your thought process, what you're looking to achieve instead of superb, but undocumented automation magic.

In a previous course you may have produced applications (frontend, backend, API), alternatively you could use [this project](https://github.com/u1i/nodejs-test) as a basis.

Pushing new commits to the repository should trigger a workflow that does something with your code. It could be a notification on a chat app, executing tests, packaging it up, or deploying it to the cloud. Bonus points if you do several of these, but that is not the expectation.


## Tips & Guidelines

* Your GitHub repository should contain
    * Application Source Code
    * Workflow(s)
    * README.md (or any other document) that explains the outcome, your steps, and your thought process
* Start with an empty (or initialized) GitHub repository. As you implement and make changes, do a commit + push each time
